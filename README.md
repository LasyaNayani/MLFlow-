# MLFlow Lecture Notes 

**ADSP 32023 IP01 (Spring 2025) - Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning**

This repository contains my notes and Google Colab notebook from the Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning course at the University of Chicago, Spring 2025.

I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for this course.

The notebook demonstrates how to use MLflow for tracking machine learning experiments, with the EuroSAT dataset as an example.

**How to use**

Open and run the notebook in Google Colab here:
